Hello, my name is Can, pronounced like the "g" in "giraffe" and the "un" in "unexpected." Alternatively, you can call me Bear.
I am a Turkish student and a passionate enthusiast of 3D printing. Since 2021, I have been actively involved in exploring the capabilities of 3D printers.
Currently, I own a Creality CR10 V2, which I have heavily modified to enhance its performance and expand its functionalities.
This has allowed me to experiment and push the boundaries of what the printer can achieve.
In addition to 3D printing, I have a keen interest in flying RC planes and honing my skills in programming.
I am proficient in Python and JavaScript, which have enabled me to develop innovative projects and bring my ideas to life.
One of my ongoing endeavors is the Polybot project, where I am investing my time and efforts.
